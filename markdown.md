## Cats and C#
C# needs to add a new built-in datatype, `cat`
The `cat` datatype always has the same value, so there is no need to initialize.

```
cat cookie; // Perfectly valid code
cat barbecue = 90; // Very bad
```

`cat` does something that no other data type can do.
If a variable of type `cat` is in scope, the program will print _"MEOW!"_ at random times.
The more variables of type `cat` in there are in scope, the more _MEOW_'s there will be.
